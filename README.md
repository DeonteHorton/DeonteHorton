### Hi Visitor! ðŸ‘‹
# A quick intro about me
My name is Deonte Horton and I've been coding for 3 and a half years now but only 2 and a half professionally now. I currently use Laravel PHP and Vuejs. I would have never thought I would be this intrigued by this but I am and very ambitious about it haha.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cool laravel projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker and some advanced concepts on Laravel and Vuejs, 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I played soccer for 11 years and I'm really good at it, also video games too.
